## Functionality
Users should locate the index.js file within this repository on their local system once they've installed it/forked the repository linked to in the screenshot section above. 

Once there, they need to use node index.js to run the inquirer package. 

This will then provide the user with a series of questions which prompt them to answer in a way that means the README file will be built with relevant, quality information.

The README file will consist of:
- The title of the project
- The licence that the project was built under
- Links to the person's GitHub profile, and a statement with their GitHub username
- An installation section which explains how to install the project
- A usage section which tells users how to use the project
- A testing section which gives advice on testing the code
- A contribution section, giving advice on how people can contribute to the project
- And a questions section, detailing where you can get in touch should you have any questions.

If a user doesn't have a licence, or the one they want is not listed, they can select "Other" which will leave the licence section out.
