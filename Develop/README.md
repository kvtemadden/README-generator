  ## Installation
  Users can install this project by forking the repository, once installed on their local system (git clone) then the user will be able to run the generator using terminal or command line.

  ## Usage
  Users should locate the index.js file within this repository on their local system once they've installed it. Once there, they need to use node index.js to run the inquirer package. This will then provide the user with a series of questions which prompt them to answer in a way that means the readme file will be built with relevant, quality information.

  ## Testing
  You can test this project by inserting console logs within the generate markdown code. This will allow you to see the different outputs, particularly via the licence list, within the terminal/command line.

  ## Contribution
  This project is not currently accepting contributions.
